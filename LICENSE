All the non-tactics code in this library is released under the 3-clause BSD license, as defined in the LICENSE-BSD3 file.

For the tactics code things are more complicated. Many of the implementations were inspired by [1] which is licensed under the LGPL version 3, as defined in the LICENSE-LGPLv3 file. And the tactics in Util.Tactics.Crush were inspired by [2] which is licenced under CC-by-nc-nd 3.0 as defined at [3]. It is unclear to what extend these two inspirations impose requirements on the licensing for this library.
