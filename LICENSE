This library comprises two sets of code:
* the tactics code (in ./src/Tactics), and
* the non-tactics code (everything else).


=== The non-tactics code ===

All the non-tactics code in this library is released under the
3-clause BSD license, as defined in the LICENSE-BSD3 file.


=== The ./src/Tactics code ===

I would like to release this code under the 3-clause BSD license,
as defined in the LICENSE-BSD3 file; however, it's not entirely
clear to me whether this is permissible.

I was taught how to write Ltac code by reading through both [1]
(which is licensed under the LGPL version 3, as defined in the
LICENSE-LGPLv3 file) and [2] (which is licenced under CC-by-nc-nd
3.0 as defined at [3]). It is not entirely clear to me whether this
means my tactics code legally counts as a "derivative work". It's
also not entirely clear how things like Ltac really work with regards
to the LGPL. On the one hand, Ltac can be considered like a compiler,
and hence the Gallina code it generates should be able to be licensed
freely. On the other hand, there's no really good way to abstract
over the Ltac code in order to allow drop-in replacements, since
we can't disentangle the specification of the generated Gallina
code (or rather, what goals it can solve) from the text of the Ltac
code itself.

So I will leave things here, and hope someone wiser than me can
figure it out.
